## 📌 Repository

Ezy-Parking is a complete parking management system applying smart solutions for short time rental of empty spaces (Parking, Apartment, Office Spaces etc). This website is designed to helps users find safe, affordable and low cost parking to get rest easy while on a hustle.

This is a most prominent trouble especially in metropolitan and tier-1 cities where vehicles are used at maximum potential in their daily lives. With no space to park their vehicles, it's evitable to have seen or prone to careless parking on roads or unauthorized places which disrupts the smooth flow of passages for society.


## ✔ Features

- It allows users to get suggestions on parking locations (renders on map with information of price and availability using area / pincode) based on their schedules one plans to attend. While searching, it also shows with events nearby.
- User can dynamically track empty parking spots to park their vehicles in a lot at the nearest slot available and releases slots as car surpasses the location.
- It allows to book/reserve the parking slots in prior to reaching the authorized parking lot.
- Opens up the gate/handle of parking lot for vehicles to enter the space using sensing techniques.
- While exiting, it automatically checks the complete history of the car using vehicle registration number (owner authority, licence checking, pending challans).
- With vehicle registration number and color of vehicle, user can easily track their vehicle location in a hump through their own device.
- Using sensor, it updates parking lot metrics which in turn is sent to database for users to view the details.
- If vehicle is parked in No parking zone, an user can detect vehicle owner details and email that the vehicle has been taken by RTO.
- Users can also share the best spots via posts for the community.
